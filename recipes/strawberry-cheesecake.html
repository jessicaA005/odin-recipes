             <p>Pour strawberry sauce into a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.
             Boil and stir until sauce is thick and shiny, about 2 minutes. Set aside 1/3 cup strawberry sauce; cool. 
            Cover and refrigerate remaining sauce for serving.</p> 

           <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>Beat cream cheese in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; 
            gradually beat in condensed milk. Mix in lemon juice and vanilla extract, 
            then beat in eggs on low speed until just combined.</p> 
        
            <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
            <p>Pour 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture over crust; drop 1/2 of the reserved 
                strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on cream cheese layer.Carefully spoon remaining cream cheese mixture over sauce; 
                drop remaining strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on top.Cut through the top layer only with a knife to swirl strawberry sauce.
            Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, 45 to 50 minutes.</p>             

            <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
            <p>Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen; cool for 1 hour at room temperature. 
                Refrigerate at least 4 hours to overnight before serving.Serve reserved strawberry sauce with cheesecake. If sauce is too thick, stir in water.</p>
